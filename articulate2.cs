//    A key idea in computer science is abstraction, 
//    it involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential details while hiding unnecessary complexity
//    It allows us to create models and representations that capture the core aspects of a system, without getting bogged down in the implementation details.
//    It allows us to create models and representations that capture the core aspects of a system, without getting bogged down in the implementation details.
//    One significant benefit of abstraction is that it promotes modularity and code organization. By abstracting away implementation details,
//    we can create reusable and modular components that are easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
//    It also enables code reuse, as abstracted components can be used in different contexts without requiring modifications.
//   
//   Below is a code example in C# to illustrate abstraction in my journal program that i submitted earlier:
     public abstract class Entry
{
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public abstract void Write(string content);
}

public class JournalEntry : Entry
{
    private string content;

    public override void Write(string content)
    {
        this.content = content;
        // Additional logic to handle writing to a journal entry
    }
}

public class CreativeEntry : Entry
{
    private string content;

    public override void Write(string content)
    {
        this.content = content;
        // Additional logic to handle writing to a creative entry
    }
}

public class Journal
{
    private List<Entry> entries;

    public void AddEntry(Entry entry)
    {
        entries.Add(entry);
        // Additional logic to handle adding an entry to the journal
    }

    // Other methods for managing and retrieving entries
}
//   In this example, the Entry class acts as an abstraction for both journal entries and creative entries.
//   EThe Journal class manages a collection of entries, abstracting away the details of individual entry types. 
//   Each concrete implementation (JournalEntry and CreativeEntry) provides its own implementation of the Write method. 
//   This way, the program can interact with entries using a common abstraction without worrying about the specific implementation details.S
